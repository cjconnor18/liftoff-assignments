# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This application provides the ability to create, edit, and delete help tickets. It is access controlled by three different user types: Client, Technician, and Administrator. The Client has the ability to rank the ticket according to importance, the Technician would have the ability to rank according to their importance.

The idea came from while I was working. I am able to log into a website to submit tickets for technology issues we may have with our servers. I felt that this kind of application would help me everyday at work for other coworkers to be able to submit tickets for help with their computers, software phones, etc. Also when I get done with the more emergent tickets, I could look at the less severe tickets and work on one that I might have otherwise forgotten.  



### Features
